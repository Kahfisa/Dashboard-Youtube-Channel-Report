## Insight
- The trend in the number of viewers on the YouTube channel shows a fairly fluctuating pattern throughout the observation period. The highest view counts occurred at the end of the month, specifically on November 22, 2025 and October 31, 2025, with 997 and 977 viewers respectively.
- The audience distribution spans several continents, including the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. However, viewer contributions are not evenly distributed across all countries within each continent. For example, in Africa, only Cameroon is recorded as a source of viewership. The largest number of viewers comes from the United States, totaling 10,000 viewers. With the high viewership from the United States, efforts to maintain and increase engagement from that country can include creating content that is more relevant to American audiences and scheduling video uploads to align with U.S. time zones.
- Viewer interactions covering likes, dislikes, and subscriptions—reached their highest level in November, then declined in October, and were at their lowest in December.
